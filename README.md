## IG2GD
This is a Geode mod for importing levels from *The Impossible Game* into *Geometry Dash*. Importing is identical to how it works in TIG, you select the folder that contains your level, and it'll load it into your savefile. It won't (and cannot) load songs, nor will the physics be 100% accurate, so some levels may need some tuning-up after import.

### Credits
- @HJFod - Some level importing logic (adapted from [GDShare](https://github.com/HJfod/GDShare)), also helped me figure out what I was doing in general :P
- @TechStudent10 - helped me figure out how GJGameLevel works
- @iAndyHD3 - also me figure out how GJGameLevel works
